# Stock Jet Adjustments

This add-on extends the stock jet engine atmCurve float curves to account for higher atmospheric densities. While not useful on its own on Kerbin or Laythe, this allows for stronger thrust on Kopernicus-generated worlds with denser, oxygenated atmospheres. This also includes parts that can gather intake air and create oxidizer, extending the air-breathing performance range of the R.A.P.I.E.R. engine and enabling air-augmented rockets, which may reduce the amount of on-board oxidizer needed.

The atmCurve extensions came from using Advanced Jet Engines on a Kopernicus-generated world named Tellumo, which has a sea-level air density exceeding twelve times that of Kerbin, and measuring the static thrust at higher air densities. The results are in the spreadsheet in this project.

The air compressor parts work like industrial oxygen concentrators, which separate out nitrogen from air using a mineral sieve and varying air pressures. Of three possible oxygen separation techniques, this proved the simplest to model.

To use these parts, install a current edition of Module Manager first, then copy this folder to your GameData folder. If you're using Kopernicus, you already have a supported Module Manager edition.
